## The Beginning

Bismillah, Being able to open up in own blog is different from being able to open up in media social. This 
platform is the where i can share the my own achievement, progress or anything personal that can be the potray in my best way as possible. Insyaallah, with all of the strenght given i will keep this platform update frequently.

The main objective of this blog is to share with the community about my experince and knowledge in information
technology.
