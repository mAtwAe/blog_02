[{"content":"HI there! Hi, My name is Muhammad Ridhuan.\nTo be honest, never though of creating blog. Being able to open up in own blog is different from being able to open up in media social. This platform is a place where i can share the my achievement, progress or anything personal that can be portray in my best way as possible. I will keep this platform update often.\nThe main objective of this blog is to share with the community about my experience and knowledge in information technology.So far, what i did was only discover or explore in python and java. Maybe in the next few month, i be able to learn kubernetes, AWS, deploying using docker and many more.\nLearning is actually a privilege not everyone have. Being able to share this means to share the knowledge i have with the community and this means a lot to me.\n","permalink":"https://ridhuan.dev/posts/page/","summary":"HI there!
