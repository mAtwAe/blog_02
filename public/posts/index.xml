      <description>Hi there! Hi, My name is Muhammad Ridhuan.
To be honest, never though of creating blog. Being able to open up in own blog is different from being able to open up in media social. This platform is a place where i can share the my achievement, progress or anything personal that can be portray in my best way as possible. I will keep this platform update often.
The main goal of this blog is to share with the community about my experience and knowledge in information technology.</description>
